In this game, a word is considered to be linked to the previous word if at least one letter at the beginning of the word matches the last letter of the previous word. Create a program that can take two words as input and determine whether these two words can be used in the word-linking game. If they can, the program should also display the longest subword that can link the two given words.\n",
